# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity projects completed as part of my learning journey through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and self-guided practical exercises.

The projects focus on incident analysis, security monitoring, phishing investigation, and basic security automation using Python. All projects are designed to reflect real-world SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst tasks.

## 🔐 Projects Included

### 1. Hospital Ransomware Incident – Case Study (Simulated)
- Analyzed a ransomware attack scenario targeting a hospital environment.
- Identified attack vectors, attack progression, and indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Documented detection, response, and prevention strategies.
- Mapped attacker behavior to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### 2. Tech Company Account Compromise – Case Study (Simulated)
- Investigated an account compromise caused by credential stuffing.
- Analyzed authentication abuse and unauthorized access patterns.
- Documented SOC detection and response actions.
- Mapped relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

### 3. Manual Log Analysis – Automated Scanning Detection
- Analyzed firewall, IDS, and application logs using spreadsheet-based techniques.
- Established baseline behavior and identified abnormal automated scanning activity.
- Correlated request paths, user agents, source IPs, and timing patterns.
- Produced an analyst timeline, conclusions, and security recommendations.

### 4. Password Strength Checker – Python Security Automation
- Developed a Python script to evaluate password strength based on security policy rules.
- Implemented checks for password length, uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.
- Classified passwords as weak, moderate, or strong based on defined criteria.
