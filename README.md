# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity projects completed as part of my learning journey through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and self-guided practical exercises.

The projects focus on incident analysis, security monitoring, phishing investigation, and basic security automation using Python. All projects are designed to reflect real-world SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst tasks.

## ## 🔐 Projects Included

### 1. Incident Case Studies
- [Hospital Ransomware Incident – Case Study](Incident-Case-Studies/Hospital-Ransomware-Case-Study.md)  
  *Analyzed a ransomware attack scenario targeting a hospital, including attack progression, IOCs, detection, response, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.*

- [Account Compromise Incident – Case Study](Incident-Case-Studies/Account-Compromise-Case-Study.md)  
  *Investigated an account compromise caused by credential reuse and lack of MFA, focusing on detection, response, and prevention.*

### 2. Log Analysis
- [Automated Scanning Detection – Log Analysis](Log-Analysis/Automated-Scanning-Detection.md)  
  *Analyzed firewall, IDS, and application logs to identify automated reconnaissance and scanning activity.*

---

### 3. Python Security Scripts
- [Password Strength Checker (Python)](Python-Security-Scripts/password_strength_checker.py)  
  *Developed a Python script to evaluate password strength based on security policy rules.*
